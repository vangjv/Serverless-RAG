- **Layered Architecture**  
  -  Separate the application into distinct layers: Domain, Application, and Infrastructure. The *Domain* layer should encapsulate business logic without dependency on technical concerns (e.g., persistence or UI).
  
- **Entities and Value Objects**  
  -  Model domain entities with rich behavior (avoid the anemic model).  
  -  Use value objects to represent concepts that do not have a unique identity and can be immutable.  
  -  Group related domain concepts into aggregates and designate an aggregate root to ensure consistency.

- **Repositories and Services**  
  -  Define repository interfaces in the Domain layer and implement them in the Infrastructure layer.  
  -  Use domain services for operations that do not naturally belong to entities.  
  -  Emphasize a ubiquitous language in naming domain classes, methods, and properties to align with the business model.
