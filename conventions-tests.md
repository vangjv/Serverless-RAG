# Testing Framework
Write test for the NUnit framework (NUnit 4.2.2 and NUnit3TestAdapter 4.6.0)

# Separate Production and Testing Code
Keep your production code and test code in separate directories. A common convention is to create a root solution folder with subdirectories like "src" for application projects and "tests" for test projects. This clear separation helps avoid accidental deployment of test code and makes builds and CI/CD pipelines easier to configure.

# Mirror the Folder Structure
Within the "tests" folder, structure your test projects so that they mirror the "src" folder’s layout. For example, if you have a production module in "src/MyFeature", create a corresponding test project (or subfolder within a test project) for that module in "tests/MyFeature.Tests". This mirroring makes it easy to locate the test for any given class or feature, as the namespace and folder structure remain consistent across both code and tests.

# Group Tests by Type
If you use different testing strategies such as unit tests, integration tests, or UI tests, consider grouping them into separate folders (or even separate projects) under the "tests" directory. For example, you might have folders named "UnitTests" and "IntegrationTests." This separation keeps the purpose of tests clear and prevents overcrowding within a single test project.

# Test Project Names
Name each test project by appending a suffix—commonly ".Tests" or ".UnitTests"—to the corresponding production project name. For example, if your production project is named "Store.ApplicationCore," the matching test project can be "Store.ApplicationCore.Tests."

# Test File Names
Within test projects, name individual test files so they reflect their counterpart production file. For instance, if you are testing a class named "Calculator" in production, the test file can be named "CalculatorTests.cs." 

# Test Method Naming
Use descriptive names for test methods (often following patterns like MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior) to make it clear what each test verifies.
